    So welcome, this part of the site is made to tell you more about me, my personality accomplishments etc.
</p>
<p >
    Lets start then, I am a student of quantitative methods in economics on University of agriculture in Nitra, as my bachelorÂ´s field of study i finished business management, which quite obviously was not something for me. As of now in year 2021 i am still studying 4th year total and first year of my Master's level of study. I plan to keep this site up to date, but stuff happens so if its 2 years from now, i most probably finnished my Masters degree, YAY ME. About my field of study, its a mostly analytical field focused on statistical analysis of data mostly in the economical field. Which indicates that i feel confident with maths and statistics. I do have a lot to learn in this field though.
</p>
<p >
    I am able to work in statistical software Sas Enterprise guide. That specifically means that i can run various data analysis, prepare data and correctly interpret the output provided by software. I can also work with full MS office package on advanced level and i have basics in VBA. I can also work with Python programming language on Intermediate++ - Advanced level, although it's hard to determine your own level in it. I fully understand all basic and intermediate concepts and i can work with various frameworks, modules, libraries. In the IT field though i am a newbie and my biggest disadvantage is that I'm a self-taught "developer"(kind of weird to call myself that) , but my advantage is that im determined and hard-working.
</p>
<p>
  Do i have experience? Unfortunately real work experience is something i lack of in this field, I have experience in other fields though.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        I used to work as a receptionist in a four star hotel in Bratislava, this was a work where i was working on off in different periods during university based of my needs and the hotels needs.
    </li>

    </li>
</ul>

<p >
    if you got to this point of this, cover letter thing, you are wondering why did i make this site? Well for numerous reason
</p>
<ul>
    <li>i am trying to learn, so the best way of learning is practice</li>
    <li>CV's and cover letters are sometimes limited and i think this is a easier way to "show what i got" ;)</li>
    <li>B R A G G I N G - cause if nothing else all this work has to be good for something</li>
</ul>
